== Overview
Fabric8 Planner is a task planner and the issue tracker front-end for link:https://openshift.io/[openshift.io].
It uses the link:https://github.com/fabric8-services/fabric8-wit[Fabric8 Work Item Tracker] as the back-end. 

The Planner project provides a component library which is used by other applications to provide a task planning front-end.

== Running the Planner

The Planner is available as an npm package. It can not be run by itself as it is an Angular component library.

However, for development and testing purpose, a minimal runtime environment is available in the link:runtime[*_runtime_*] directory. So you can run Planner either as a minimal Standalone component or as an Integrated component using an external webapp like the *_fabric8-ui_*. Typically, you would want to develop in the Standalone mode and test your changes in the Integrated mode. 

=== Quickstart

The Planner build can be quickly run using the link:scripts/run-planner.sh[launcher script].

You can use the launcher script to run the Planner either as a Standalone component or as an Integrated component using an external webapp like the fabric8-ui.

- *Without Docker:* To run a minimal runtime implementation of the Planner using an in-memory mock database use:
+
[sh]
----
$ scripts/run-planner.sh --standalone
----
You can access the service on *`localhost:8080`*
+
NOTE: To run the script on macOS, install `gnu-getopt`, run `brew install gnu-getopt`, and set it in your PATH:
 `echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/gnu-getopt/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc`.

- *With Docker:* To run the complete Planner stack using *`Docker Compose`* with link:https://github.com/fabric8-services/fabric8-wit[core], link:https://github.com/fabric8-services/fabric8-auth[auth] and their respective database setups use:
+
[sh]
----
docker-compose up
----

For detailed information on building and running Planner see link:docs/building_planner.adoc[Building the Planner Component Library] documentation.

== Useful Scripts and Tasks

The Planner delegates task running to `gulp` and allows parametric subtasks in the format of `npm run <task> \-- --subtask` which translates into `gulp <task> --subtask` which is then can be executed.

The `scripts` section of the link:package.json[*_package.json_*] file lists the main tasks i.e. `build`, `clean` & `test`. Following table lists the available npm scripts managed with `gulp` tasks, but to understand the routines triggered by the subtask parameters, please check out the link:gulpfile.js[*_gulpfile_*]:
