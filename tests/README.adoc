= Test Runner

This project contains a simple test runner for Protractor Angular tests. The intention is to have an 
isolated test runner that does not share dependencies with code under test. This test runner works
standalone and just needs to be pointed at a set of Typescript test specs and an URL to test them on.

Please note that this test runner is for **black box tests** only!

== Preparing the Test Runner

The test runner installs it's own dependencies automatically. You just need `node/npm` available in
the current context. You will also need to have `curl` and `bash` installed on your system 
and available in the path. **You don't need to do `npm install` in the runner directory**.

== Providing Test Specs

To run a test suite, you need to create a set of test specs (which may include page objects). The
test specs source directory needs to include a `tsconfig.json` configuration file. The path to the 
spec source directory has to be provided using the env variable `TEST_SOURCE_PATH`:

== Running Tests

Next, you need to provide a URL of the system under test using the env variable `BASE_URL`. If 
`BASE_URL` is not set, `http://localhost:8090/` is used.

Tests can then be run with:

```
npm test
```

This will get all local dependencies, compile the specs, add runtime dependencies and runs the test specs. You can
also give a suite to run as the first argument.

*Note*: if you are developing Planner, then is recommended to use the provided script 
```
$(PLANNER_ROOT)/scripts/run-functests.sh
```
to run the tests. This script will build and start the Planner debug server and then runs the tests.

It is also possible to run the tests as a black box runner using the script `tests/run.sh`.

== Additional Configuration

The test runner supports the following env variables to configure behaviour:

|=======
|`BASE_URL` | URL of the system under test. Defaults to `http://localhost:8088/`.
|`ACCESS_TOKEN` | JWT Access Token to access the instance. Defaults to an example JWT token that can be used on local dev instances of OSIO.
|`TEST_SOURCE_PATH` | Path to the spec source directory. Defaults to the included examples in `example-test-src`.
|`TEMP_DIR` | Temporary directory for the test run. Defaults to a generated temporary directory.
|`SPECS_PATTERN` | File pattern for the Protractor run. This should never be modified/set.
|=======

The test runner uses a fixed set of dependencies defined in `package.json` of the test runner. The specs will
run with the same dependencies. If you need additional dependencies, you may have to modify the test runner's 
`package.json`.

== Test Development

The access token given on the runtime environment is available to the test context via `browser.params.accessToken`. This can be utilized
to implement constructors for page objects like this:

```
constructor(login: boolean) {
  if (login) {
    console.log(browser.params.accessToken);
    let url = encodeURIComponent(JSON.stringify(JSON.parse(browser.params.accessToken)));
    browser.get(browser.baseUrl + "/?token_json=" + url);
  } else {
    browser.get(browser.baseUrl);
  }
}
```

Make sure the env variable contains a valid JWT and that the JSON syntax is followed. The base url is available 
on the `browser.baseUrl` variable.
